Carriage Return (Mac pre-OS X)

CR
`\r`
ASCII code 13
Line Feed (Linux, Mac OS X)

LF
`\n`
ASCII code 10
Carriage Return and Line Feed (Windows)

CRLF
`\r\n`
ASCII code 13 and then ASCII code 10
If you see ASCII code in a strange format, they are merely the number 13 and 10 in a different radix/base, usually base 8 (octal) or base 16 (hexadecimal).
