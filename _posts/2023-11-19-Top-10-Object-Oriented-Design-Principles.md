1. DRY (Don't repeat yourself) - avoids duplication in code
2. Encapsulate what changes - hides implementation detail, helps in maintenance
3. Open Closed design principle - open for extension, closed for modification
4. SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) - one class should do one thing and do it well
5. DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle) - don't ask, let framework give to you
6. Favor Composition over Inheritance - Code reuse without cost of inflexibility
7. LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle) - Sub type must be substitutable for super type
8. ISP (Interface Segregation Principle) - Avoid monolithic interface, reduce pain on client side
9. Programming for Interface - Helps in maintenance, improves flexibility
10. Delegation principle - Don't do all things by yourself, delegate it
